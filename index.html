        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My objective is to become a web designer. I have always had a passion for the web and now I want to be part of designing the sites that are viewed on it.</p>
        <p>I was a teacher for most of my life, part of which entailed not only teaching students technology, but adults as well. Once technology became a big part of my life I knew it was the field I was destined to be a part of and I am now going to take it to new heights.</p>
        <p>Alongside teaching I worked many other jobs. That, along with years of wisdom, has me excited to bring my experience to developing outstanding websites.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I will gain the knowledge necessary to develop web sites and continually increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
